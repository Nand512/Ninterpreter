# NandConverter
The NandConverter is a project designed to convert the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller's USB-C connection to a GC port on the wii.
The goal of this is to be able to use a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller as if it were a Gamecube controller. I want the best of both worlds between a Gamecube controller (better button layout, but I can't stand analog triggers) and a Classic Controller Pro (worse layout, digital triggers).
I could short the springs in my GCN, but that's above my paygrade.

Christopher Wang has a very insightful API for interacting with a GCN here (https://os.mbed.com/users/christopherjwang/code/gamecube_controller/).
